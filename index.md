title: Las Vegas Ruby User Group
---

LVRUG is the place to learn and share information about Ruby, the
Ruby on Rails framework, and related technologies in Las Vegas.

We cover several different languages and tend to focus on web
applications and ruby.  We welcome:

* Ruby developers looking to network with other Ruby
  developers in Las Vegas.
* Beginners looking to learn about the Ruby language.
* Entrepreneurs who want to learn how to code their ideas.
* Anyone who wants to learn more about computer programing or share
  their excitement.

Our primary activity is the biweekly [Las Vegas Ruby
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/las-vegas-ruby-on-rails/).  The Meetup
opens with classroom-style Ruby instruction and concludes with
presentations on any of a variety of topics relevant to Ruby
programmers, from fundamental computer science to how to pick the best
web fonts.
